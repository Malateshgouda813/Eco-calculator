## Project Demonstration & Workflow

### 1️⃣ Eco Calculator Dashboard (Initial Interface)

![Eco Calculator Dashboard](https://github.com/Malateshgouda813/Eco-calculator/blob/62373bdd189f5ca791522c25348b52439e41f8bf/Screenshot%20(369).png)

This image shows the **initial interface** of the Eco Calculator.

- Users enter details under different categories:
  - **Travel**: car usage, fuel type, public transport distance, flights
  - **Home Energy**: monthly electricity usage and heating type
  - **Diet**: diet preference and food waste
- The layout is designed to be **simple, clean, and intuitive**
- No calculations are performed until the user provides inputs and clicks **Calculate**

This screen represents the **starting point** of the application.



### 2️⃣ Input Submission & Carbon Footprint Estimation

This image shows the application **after entering inputs and clicking the Calculate button**.

- The system calculates the **total annual CO₂ emissions**
- Results are displayed under **“Your Estimate”**
- A detailed **breakdown** is shown for:
  - Car emissions
  - Public transport emissions
  - Flight emissions
  - Electricity usage
  - Heating
  - Diet and food waste
- The application also provides **personalized suggestions** to reduce emissions

This step demonstrates the **core calculation logic** of the project.



### 3️⃣ Downloaded Carbon Footprint Report

This image displays the **downloaded report file** generated by the application.

- The report contains:
  - Total annual carbon footprint estimate
  - Category-wise emission breakdown
  - Practical suggestions for reducing CO₂ emissions
- The report can be saved, shared, or used for documentation and awareness

This feature adds **real-world usability** by allowing offline access to results.



## 📄 Sample Output

- **Total Emissions:** 5,264.2 kg CO₂ / year  
- **Major Contributors:**  
  - Electricity usage  
  - Diet  
  - Personal vehicle travel  



## 🎯 Project Objective

The objective of this project is to:

- Create awareness about **carbon emissions**
- Help users understand how daily activities affect the environment
- Encourage **eco-friendly and sustainable lifestyle choices**


## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- Add graphical visualization (charts & graphs)
- User authentication and history tracking
- Country-specific emission factors
- Export reports in PDF format
- AI-based personalized reduction plans


## 📌 Conclusion

The **Eco Calculator** provides a complete end-to-end solution for estimating personal carbon footprints.  
By combining **calculation, visualization, and reporting**, the project helps users make **informed and sustainable decisions** for a greener future.
